# Web Development
You must have come across hundreds of colorful and well-organized websites while surfing the Internet. Have you ever wondered how these websites are designed? Well, to know that you have to enter the world of Web Development. So, let’s begin.

## What is Web Development?

**Web development is the building and maintenance of websites**, it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look `great`, `work` `fast` and `perform well` with a `seamless user experience`. It ranges from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. The field of web development can be divided into _front-end_ development (the user-facing side), _back-end_ development (the server side) and _full-stack_ development.  
•	**Frontend Development**  
•	**Backend Development**  
•	**Full Stack Development**  

## What is Frontend Development?

**Front-end development** deals with the `layout`, `design` and `interactivity` using _HTML, CSS_ and _JavaScript__. The visual aspect of the website, the drop-down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. It is known as client-side development.  

## What is Backend Development?

**The backend** of the web consists of the **server** that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like `PHP`, `Ruby`, `Python` and `NodeJS`.

## What is Full Stack Development?

**Full stack web development** deals with the development of both `client` and `server` software. Full-stack developers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web works on all levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate.
