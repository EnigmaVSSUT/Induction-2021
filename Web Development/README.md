What is Web Development?

Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. It ranges from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. The field of web development can be divided into front-end development (the user-facing side), back-end development (the server side) and full-stack development. 
•	Frontend Development 
•	Backend Development 
•	Full Stack Development 

What is Frontend Development?

Front-end development deals with the layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The visual aspect of the website, the drop-down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. It is known as client-side development. 
What is Backend Development?

The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and NodeJS. 

What is Full Stack Development?

Full stack web development deals with the development of both client and server software. Full-stack developers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web works on all levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate.
