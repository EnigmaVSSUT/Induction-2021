            <p>
                <img src="yash.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="about me">
                My name is yash jain. I am a first year btech studen. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and
                that I like to study. My favorite subjects are mathematics and programing. I entered the university
                because my goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a respected professional in one of
                the fields.
                I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have
                many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I
                enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help.
                The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with
                challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.

                My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting boy with a good sense of humor. As soon as I
                meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that
                friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many
                interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who
                surround me.

                Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but
                also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surround me now I met on the
                street while doing my hobby.

                What to speak about this stimulating interest? Traveling is another pastime which compels me to stopover
                a new place, city, beach, village or mountain. It is consequently exciting to observe a new place and
                convene various types of citizens. Traveling allows me to employ my talent in photography. I always keep
                camera with me whenever I trip to a newer place and then I prefer capturing the photo-shots of
                buildings, people, marketplaces, and shrines of that place. In this way, I wisely spend my leisure
                time.I also love to travel, because being in a new place means I’m allow to indulge and spoil myself.
                Pampering myself has become even more important on solo trips in my 30s, honestly.I deeply believe
                travel makes you richer, not in your wallet, but in your intelligence and compassion. Not to mention,
                roaming this planet makes you realize your full potential and helps you learn what makes you truly
                happy. Let’s break it down.

                The most important purpose of living my life in an effective and peaceful manner is always be honest
                whatever you do, be persistent and be delegated towards my work.

                Here I’m going to represent my current skills and knowledge and make analyze of those skills required
                for my future career.
                As a matter of fact, my teamwork skills developed from my childhood. Nevertheless, its improved by doing
                group presentations, assignments with my groupmates. I believe that, having teams can result in faster
                and efficient outputs with better decision making skills. “Coming together is a beginning. Keeping
                together is progress. Working together is success”(Ford, 1923). Comparatively, there are various
                advantages of teamwork for career development. For instance, It improves profitability as well as
                productivity as all the employees are highly motivated and skilled. A business or cooperation will not
                survive unless all members work as one team.

                Accordingly, people all want to be successful in their working as it also brings happiness to them. To
                do this, there are considerable numbers of skills which they need to have. There are several learning
                outcomes that I gained from different modules during study foundation year at university. Those outcomes
                helped me identify my academic and personal skills, which I’m going to improve during year 2 and year 3.
                Furthermore those skills provide the basic foundation to get, keep and progress on a job and to achieve
                the best results.
