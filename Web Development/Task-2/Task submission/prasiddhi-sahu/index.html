     <p>I am interested in anything that I find interesting. Though I tend 
         to get attracted towards computer, technology, space and wildlife, I will just as 
         likely find something interesting in other fields like lost tombs of Egyptian royals
         or just watching mouthwatering foods on TLC. I also love travelling.
