        <P> 
             Hi! I'm Chandan Kumar Haboda. I'm 19 years old and currently doing my graduation in Computer Science at VSSUT, Burla, Odisha. I am from Baripada, Odisha.
            I like to think positively and always think <i>"Whatever happens always happens for a good reason"</i>.
             I love to learn stuffs which arouse interests in me. So  I started learning Web and Coding. As the web is growing, I think Anonymity is super Power and a way to remain safe. Coding has changed my way to percieve the world.It is not just about apps.
            Learning coding gave me <i>problem Solving</i> as well as a way to communicate with others on a technical level. 
        </P>
