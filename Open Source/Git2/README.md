# Task2

## Problem Statement: 

 

Your task is : 

- Update your local repo's main branch  

- Add an image of something with the following specifications: 

    **Image File Name**: The image file name must be your name only. 
    
    _for example_ [Ashutosh-Khanduala.jfif](./Ashutosh-khanduala.jfif)

    **Image File Location**: ./Open Source/Git2/ 

    **Content in that Image**:- Can be anything nice(e.g. your face, or a dish, or a pet, etc). 


Now commit your changes and push your file to your forked repo and create a PR. Mentors will automatically come to know if you have updated your outdated repo or not.

⚠⚠⚠IMPORTANT⚠⚠⚠ 

1. Put that new file in /Open Source/Git2/  folder only 

If your PR doesn’t follow the above instruction strictly then your PR will be Rejected!
