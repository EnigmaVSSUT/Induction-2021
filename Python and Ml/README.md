# Python and Ml
<br>
So Welcome Everyone! to yet another exciting week. Well technically speaking, this is going to be a little longer than a week, and in this span of time, you guys will be learning Very basic Python (I see those :| faces, who did competitive coding in python! duh! but then think it like a revision, or if you may, take this as an oppurtunity to flaunt your python skills.) and shallow dive into the principles of Machine Learning.<br>
<br>
so <h3><b>WHY PYTHON?</b></h3><br>
Python is today one of the most powerful programming languages and it will still on the top in the next coming decade. Python is polyvalent, you can use it everywhere in everything and it has frameworks and libraries for the most recent technologies such as IA/machine learning, data science, robotics….<br>
Here are some reasons why python will still on top of the best programming languages in the next decade.<br>
<br>
<b>Python is simple, easy to learn and it is a high level language</b><br>
<br>
In Python, you don’t have to deal with a complex syntax, Its pretty much simple commands in english, it would seem. plus, It is free, open source and blessed with a large community.<br>
<br>
<b>Portable & Extensible</b><br>
<br>
The portable and extensible properties of Python allow you to perform cross-language operations seamlessly. Python is supported by most platforms present in the industry today ranging from Windows to Linux to Macintosh, Solaris, Play station, among others.<br>
<br>
Python’s extensibility features allow you to integrate Java as well as .NET components. You can also invoke C and C++ libraries.<br>
<br>
<b>Web Development</b><br>
Python has an array of frameworks for developing websites. The popular frameworks are Django, Flask, Pylons, etc. Since these frameworks are written in Python, it's the core reason which makes the code a lot faster and stable.<br>
<br>
You can also perform web scraping where you can fetch details from any other websites. You will also be impressed as many websites such as youtube, Instagram, The Washington post, bit bucket, Pinterest are built on these frameworks only.<br>
<br>
<b>Artificial Intelligence</b><br>
AI is the next huge development in the tech world. You can actually make a machine mimic the human brain which has the power to think, analyze and make decisions.
Furthermore, libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow bring machine learning functionality into the mix. It gives the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Also, we have libraries such as OpenCV that helps computer vision or image recognition.<br>
<br>
<b>Big Data</b><br>
Python handles a lot of hassles of data. It supports parallel computing where you can use Python for Hadoop as well. In Python, you have a library called Pydoop and you can write a MapReduce program in Python and process data present in the HDFS cluster.

There are other libraries such as Dask and Pyspark for big data processing. Therefore, Python is widely used for Big Data where you can easily process it!

<b>Data Science</b>
Python is the leading language of many data scientists. For years, academic scholars and private researchers were using the MATLAB language for scientific research but it all started to change with the release of Python numerical engines such as Numpy and Pandas.

Python also deals with the tabular, matrix as well as statistical data and it even visualizes it with popular libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.


so <h3><b>HOW TO GET STARTED?</b></h3><br>

This Section is where you gonna get all your resources for getting started with programming in python.

1. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEgO047GxaQ&list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3&index=2)'s a link to getting started with python.

2. Once you have known seen Naveen Reddy rant for a while, lets come to the actual stuff. How to setup a python environment and start to code in python. Given below are the links which you should follow, <b>IN ORDER</b> to become fimiliar with installing python, basic syntax of python as well as Data Types in python and the functions associated with them.
