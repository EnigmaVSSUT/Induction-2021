        <h1 class="h1">INTERESTS</h1>
        <p>
            <b>First of all,I am a great admirer of good music</b>.
            <ul>
                <div>
                    <li class="list">Music</li>
                    <p>
                        Since the time I became capable of listening to and singing songs,I have shown a great interest in these fields.I love to sing and write songs.I wrote my first song in the summer vacations of my 11th standard.since then,I have written 3 more songs and hope to write evn better in the days to come.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div><li class="list">Programming</li>
                    <p>
                        I consider myself luckier than many students who,unlike me,do not get the exposure to programming in their early ages.I was fortunate enough to start learning <a target="_blank" title="Go to official website." href="https://www.java.com/en/">JAVA</a> in my 9th standard as it was in my school syllabus.Before that,I was a total dumb in the field of technology.But as i kept coming across the wonders Java can do,I developed a great interest in programming and related stuffs like ethical hacking,Arduino,Robotics,Artificial Intelligence,Data Science etc.and since then,my thirst for learning new technologies continues to prosper.

                </div>
                <div><li class="list">Astronomy</li>
                <p>
                    Now comes the childhood favorite of almost all and I was,sorry,am no different.I still remember how crazy I was about things related to astronomy and sometimes I laugh at myself for downloading books related to Quantum Field Theory and Relativity when I was in my 9th standard,books that even a Physics major finds dificult.However,my love for astronomy still persists and I still watch various shows related to it on Discovery Science like I did when I was younger.

        <h1 class="h1">SKILLS</h1>
        <p>
            My skills include singing,songwriting,programming,cooking and sometimes,writing stories too.As of now i have beginner skills in programming and story writing and I am constantly working to improve them.So there is nothing which I can really boast of being skillfull in except for the singing and songwriting part.The love for music is everlasting for me and I hope I can sing even better in the coming days.
            <br>
            Now some of my other skills include boybuilding and riding motorcycles.The craze of bodybuilding started in me since I heard a quote in GTA San Andreas which said 'Ain't nobody's gonna respect you if you don't respect your body'.

        <h1 class="h1">HOBBIES</h1>
        <p>
            Usually,I love to utilize my free time in learning new things and watching series.Apart from these,I love to brush up my programming and singing skills too.I havent read more than a few books till now,but reading books is also one of my most favorite leisure activities.
            <br>
            Also,being a nature lover,I love to visit to forests and riversides and naturally beautiful areas with my friends or sometimes,alone.My other hobbies also include bodybuilding and listening to music.
